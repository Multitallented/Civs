#tut-warrior-1: "Now, put one leather in the altar chest. If you have $400, then you will receive your gear."
#tut-warrior-2: "Now you have everything you need. Your next goal is to kill someone, but avoid towns. Towns have many defenses that you have yet to learn."
#tut-warrior-3: "Now it's time to raid a town. Try one of the smaller ones if possible and avoid arrow traps. Buy and build a raid porter close to a town. Put a sign over the center with the name of the town on it."
#tut-warrior-4: "Once your raid porter is active (takes 3 minutes), stand on top of it to teleport into the town. Steal from unprotected chests and kill members for loot. Teleport out using your Civs menu when you're done."
#tut-warrior-5: "To really get some loot and force a town to come out & fight outside their walls, you'll need to siege. Build a Command tent near an enemy town."
#tut-warrior-6: "Now buy and build the Outpost on top of your Command tent. After that, buy and build the catapult."
#tut-warrior-7: "Shift+right click the enemy town with your catapult stick. The catapult will reduce the enemy town's power. Buy and build a Keep on top of your Command Tent."
#tut-warrior-8: "Now that you've built the Keep, buy and build the Castle. After that, build a Memorial. The Memorial will allow you to respawn there during battle."
#tut-warrior-9: "Congratulations! You are now wise in the ways of warfare. This concludes the warrior path."

#tut-builder-2: "Now that you've built the heart of the town, claim your land. Buy the settlement."
#tut-builder-3: "Congratulations! Create your claim with /cv town town_name_goes_here. When you've done that buy and build a shack."
#tut-builder-4: "A Shack provides housing. Housing is required to invite people to your town. Now buy and place an NPCShack inside your Shack."
#tut-builder-5: "Villagers count as population. If they die, the town loses power. Villagers respawn too. Now build a church."
#tut-builder-6: "It is important to create buildings that generate power. Power protects the town. Build an arrow_trap to further defend your town."
#tut-builder-7: "Next, build an arrow_factory to provide arrows to your defenses."
#tut-builder-8: "Settlements are limited to 4 shacks. To maximize your housing, build a shack, then buy and place a hovel inside that shack."
#tut-builder-9: "Next, build a catapult. Catapults are precise TNT cannons that you can use to destroy attacker's siege structures."
#tut-builder-10: "Go ahead and upgrade your town to a Hamlet. Once you've done that, build a Dwelling. With each new town level you get a stand alone level of housing."
#tut-builder-11: "Now upgrade your town again to the village. Once you've done that, build the Stables."
#tut-builder-12: "Before you can upgrade your village, you'll need to upgrade your Council_Room. Buy and place the Town_Hall inside your Council_Room."

#tut-merchant-1: "Go ahead and buy a shack from the shop and build it. Shacks can also be sold using /cv sell amount"
#tut-merchant-2: "Now put some potatoes in the Shack chest."
#tut-merchant-3: "Housing can be upgraded to give you more money. Buy the Hovel from the shop."
#tut-merchant-4: "Place the hovel chest in the shack. It may require you to add on to your Shack to make it a 9x9x9 region."
#tut-merchant-5: "Put 384 potatoes in your Hovel chest. In 24 hours, your Hovel will sell all of them and upgrade to a Hovel1."
#tut-merchant-6: "Buy and build an apple orchard. Build a mine cart track from inside your apple_orchard to inside your Hovel1. Place a powered rail on an incline inside the apple orchard. Finally, place a chest minecart inside the apple orchard"
#tut-merchant-7: "Time to upgrade again. Buy and place a dwelling inside your Hovel1."
#tut-merchant-8: "Dwellings give you a lot of money, but a House gives you more. Buy and upgrade your Dwelling to a House."
#tut-merchant-9: "Put this bread in your House to upgrade it to a House1."
#tut-merchant-10: "Put these salmon in your House1 to upgrade it to a House2."
#tut-merchant-11: "Now build an iron_shop to further increase your income."
